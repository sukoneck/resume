### [Daniel Sukoneck's Resume](https://resume.sukoneck.com)

This static website was built using a fun mix of HTML, CSS, Markdown, and some GitHub-behind-the-scenes Jekyll. Source code and content is hosted on GitHub (here) and presented via GitHub Pages' default theme, Primer. DNS, HTTPS, and edge cache are served by Cloudflare.
