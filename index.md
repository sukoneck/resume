 * All experience is pertinent experience, it's not what you've done as much as it is how you package your accomplishements
 * An example would be using this seemingly non-technical position to showcase leader ship skills
 * Did you communicate with cross-functional teams or people of varying technical skill levels? You can use this section to showcase that.
 * Also remember that you want to maximize your resume for buzz words. You can figure out what these are from the job posting as well as sample resumes online. This will increase your chances of getting a call for an interview.
